## Thanks
A big thanks to both [@acarlsson](https://github.com/acarlsson) who created [the first Swedish language extension](https://github.com/acarlsson/flarum-ext-swedish) for Flarum, a lot of the initial translations came from that project. And also a big thanks to [@nlssn](https://github.com/nlssn) who not only picked up after [@acarlsson](https://github.com/acarlsson) but also maintained it for quite some time. Again, thank you guys!
